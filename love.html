<p class="animate-text">From the very first moment you entered my life, you became my greatest happiness, my sweetest dream, and the most beautiful part of my world. Every second I spend with you feels like magic, and every moment apart feels like eternity. <strong>Baby, I am not only in love with you—I am obsessed with you.</strong> You are the first thought in my mind when I wake up and the last before I sleep. You are my everything, my heart, my soul, my forever.</p>

<p class="animate-text">I love it when you call me, when you text me, when you just say my name. Every message from you makes my heart race, every call makes my entire day brighter. I want to talk to you all day, every day, because nothing in this world feels as good as hearing your voice, reading your words, and feeling your love. I never get tired of you, and I never will. No matter how much time we spend together, it will never be enough for me.</p>

<p class="animate-text"><strong>I want to be with you forever.</strong> No matter where life takes us, no matter what happens, I want to walk every step of this journey with you. I want to hold your hand, laugh with you, cry with you, dream with you, and build a life that is filled with nothing but love, happiness, and endless memories. You are my safe place, my home, my heart’s greatest treasure.</p>

<p class="animate-text">I love you more than words can ever describe, and I will spend every single day proving that to you. You are mine, and I am yours—always and forever.</p>

<p class="animate-text"><strong>Yours,<br> Achaluuu</strong></p>
